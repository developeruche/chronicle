## Overview
**Chronicle** in simple terms is an indexing software, indexing transactions and modules (Smart contract, Parachain, and so on) Events. Chronicle stores these data in a Postgress DB and renders these data using an GraphQL interface. Chronicle is designed to achieve high-performance and high-reliability in cloud deployments via a modular architecture, Developers can hand-pick modules to build whatever, seeing the components of the Chronicle as pieces of **Legos**.



### Motivation

The motivation behind Chronicle lies in its mission to provide developers with a comprehensive, yet highly customizable toolset for indexing transactions and events across various blockchain networks. Whether it's monitoring smart contract interactions, tracking parachain activities, or analyzing decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols, Chronicle offers a unified solution that simplifies the complexities of data indexing.

## Status

Chronicle is under active development.
**Use in production at your own risk.**


### Chain Support
Chronicle is built to be very modular, add new chains is very frictionaless. Here are the categories of chains Chronicle is currently implemented for.

* EVM compatible chains
* Para chains
